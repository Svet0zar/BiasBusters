### Track 2: Building Trustworthy Models for Stereotype Classification in Text Data
Team Members: Erin Sarlak, Charvi Maurya, Jackson Cheung, Alexander Catterall, Svetozar Miloshevski

### Abstract:
We aim to address the findings of King, Wu, Koshiyama, Kazim, and Treleaven (2024), who identified the low availability of a high-quality labeled dataset as a limiting factor in stereotyping classification models [1].
