    "### Tutorials: Building an Ethical Classifier for Stereotype Detection Using EMGSD\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how to build an ethical classifier for stereotype detection using the **Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD)**. By incorporating sustainability, fairness, and explainability into the development process, we tackled some of the key challenges in creating trustworthy AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology is inspired by the HEARTS framework from Holistic AI, which is explained in the paper below:\n",
    "\n",
    "[**HEARTS: A Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable, and Robust Text Stereotype Detection**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11579)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Example stereotype classifier From HEARTS Paper**](https://huggingface.co/holistic-ai/bias_classifier_albertv2)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. **Sustainability**: \n",
    "   - Leveraged a small, carbon-efficient model like **ALBERT-V2** to minimize environmental impact without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "   - Used **CodeCarbon** to monitor and reduce carbon emissions during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bias Detection**: \n",
    "   - Assessed the fairness of the model across different demographic groups by analyzing counterfactual examples and ensuring consistency in predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explainability**:\n",
    "   - Utilized **SHAP** and **LIME** for token-level transparency, enabling deeper insights into the classifier's decision-making process and promoting trust and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency and Robustness**:\n",
    "   - Evaluated model performance using **Macro F1 Scores** to ensure generalization across all classes (stereotype, neutral, unrelated).\n",
    "   - Addressed the robustness of the classifier through rigorous testing on diverse texts and demographic combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - Simplified data loading, sampling, and preparation to enable flexible experimentation, with clear instructions to scale up for better performance as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Modeling and Baselines**:\n",
    "   - Progressed from simple baselines (random selection and logistic regression with TF-IDF) to advanced fine-tuned transformers (ALBERT-V2) to achieve better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, we ensured adherence to ethical principles such as **bias minimization**, **sustainability**, **efficacy**, **robustness**, and **explainability**. These principles guide the development of trustworthy AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Extended Directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Enhancement Through Additional Tutorials**:  \n",
    "   - Enrich the dataset and improve model performance by exploring the following tutorials:\n",
    "     - **[Scraping Biased Data](https://github.com/holistic-ai/hai-ucl-hackathon/blob/main/track2_text_stereotype_classification/Extra_Scraping_Biased_Data.ipynb)**: Collect and preprocess real-world biased text data from online sources to make the dataset more diverse and comprehensive.\n",
    "     - **[Generating Biased Data](https://github.com/holistic-ai/hai-ucl-hackathon/blob/main/track2_text_stereotype_classification/Extra_Generate_Biased_Data.ipynb)**: Fine-tune a biased GPT-2 model to generate stereotype-related text. Use this synthetic data to augment the EMGSD dataset for further experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Debiasing Techniques**:  \n",
    "   - Implement strategies such as counterfactual fairness to further enhance the fairness of the classifier and minimize demographic biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Further Explainability**:  \n",
    "   - Integrate advanced interpretability methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, BERTViz) to provide more detailed insights into the classifier's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Testing**:  \n",
    "   - Extend the model’s application to real-world scenarios by incorporating multi-modal data or testing in diverse, dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this tutorial, you have built a solid foundation for developing trustworthy AI systems. The outlined **future directions** and optional tutorials provide opportunities to expand your efforts, explore novel solutions, and contribute meaningfully to the field of ethical AI."

    "### Conclusion: Building an Ethical Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how to build an ethical classifier for stereotype detection using the **Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD)**. By incorporating sustainability, fairness, and explainability into the development process, we tackled some of the key challenges in creating trustworthy AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. **Sustainability**: \n",
    "   - Leveraged a small, carbon-efficient model like **ALBERT-V2** to minimize environmental impact without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "   - Used **CodeCarbon** to monitor and reduce carbon emissions during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bias Detection**: \n",
    "   - Assessed the fairness of the model across different demographic groups by analyzing counterfactual examples and ensuring consistency in predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explainability**:\n",
    "   - Utilized **SHAP** and **LIME** for token-level transparency, enabling deeper insights into the classifier's decision-making process and promoting trust and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency and Robustness**:\n",
    "   - Evaluated model performance using **Macro F1 Scores** to ensure generalization across all classes (stereotype, neutral, unrelated).\n",
    "   - Addressed the robustness of the classifier through rigorous testing on diverse texts and demographic combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - Simplified data loading, sampling, and preparation to enable flexible experimentation, with clear instructions to scale up for better performance as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Modeling and Baselines**:\n",
    "   - Progressed from simple baselines (random selection and logistic regression with TF-IDF) to advanced fine-tuned transformers (ALBERT-V2) to achieve better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "Throughout the tutorial, we ensured adherence to ethical principles such as **bias minimization**, **sustainability**, **efficacy**, **robustness**, and **explainability**. These principles guide the development of trustworthy AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Extended Directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Enhancement Through Additional Tutorials**:  \n",
    "   - Enrich the dataset and improve model performance by exploring the following tutorials:\n",
    "     - **[Scraping Biased Data](https://github.com/holistic-ai/hai-ucl-hackathon/blob/main/track2_text_stereotype_classification/Extra_Scraping_Biased_Data.ipynb)**: Collect and preprocess real-world biased text data from online sources to make the dataset more diverse and comprehensive.\n",
    "     - **[Generating Biased Data](https://github.com/holistic-ai/hai-ucl-hackathon/blob/main/track2_text_stereotype_classification/Extra_Generate_Biased_Data.ipynb)**: Fine-tune a biased GPT-2 model to generate stereotype-related text. Use this synthetic data to augment the EMGSD dataset for further experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Debiasing Techniques**:  \n",
    "   - Implement strategies such as counterfactual fairness to further enhance the fairness of the classifier and minimize demographic biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Further Explainability**:  \n",
    "   - Integrate advanced interpretability methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, BERTViz) to provide more detailed insights into the classifier's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Testing**:  \n",
    "   - Extend the model’s application to real-world scenarios by incorporating multi-modal data or testing in diverse, dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this tutorial, you have built a solid foundation for developing trustworthy AI systems. The outlined **future directions** and optional tutorials provide opportunities to expand your efforts, explore novel solutions, and contribute meaningfully to the field of ethical AI."
